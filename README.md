Dijkstra algorithm with custom value is my new project

The dijkstra algorithm is a way for finding the shortest paths between values for example this is how google maps work to find us the shortest path to the goal.
I used Restful API for making the algorithm with custom values from the clients. Of course it isn't comercial product but interesting visual example too see how the algorithm work. 

I wanted to show that I can use algorithms in my projects and I think it's the best way. 

For project I used: 
-Laravel
-Restful API
-Algorithm
-one controller
-Node js and other tools
